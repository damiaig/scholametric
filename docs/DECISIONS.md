# Decisions log

## 2026-07-12 — Activate endpoints: deactivate-then-activate, in one transaction, after a pre-check
Decision: `SessionsService.activate` / `TermsService.activate` run
`prisma.$transaction([updateMany(deactivate others), update(activate target)])`
in that exact order, preceded by a tenant-scoped `findFirst` (not inside the
transaction).
Reason: the partial unique indexes (`... WHERE is_current = true`) are
checked per-statement, not deferred — activating before deactivating would
momentarily hold two current rows for the same scope and violate the index.
The pre-check matters independently of ordering: the transaction's own
`update({ where: { id } })` has no `school_id` filter, so without it a
cross-tenant activate/patch would silently succeed against another school's
row.

## 2026-07-12 — @Roles() placement: class-level for school-setup, per-method for SchoolsController
Decision: `SessionsController`/`TermsController`/`ClassLevelsController`/
`ClassArmsController` each carry one class-level `@Roles(SCHOOL_ADMIN)`.
`SchoolsController` instead applies `@Roles(SUPER_ADMIN)` per-method (create/
findAll/findOne/update), leaving `search` with none.
Reason: `RolesGuard` falls back to class-level metadata when a method has
none — a class-level `@Roles()` on `SchoolsController` would also lock down
the pre-existing public `/schools/search` route from step 3.

## 2026-07-12 — TenantContext/forSchool now have real consumers; injected into services, not controllers
Decision: the four school-setup services take `TenantContext` in their
constructor and read `schoolId` internally; controllers never see it.
Reason: matches CLAUDE.md §4's stated architecture literally
("repositories/services receive a TenantContext"). Since `TenantContext` is
request-scoped, every service that injects it becomes request-scoped too
(Nest propagates this automatically) — expected, not a bug.

## 2026-07-12 — Prisma Date fields need `new Date(...)`, not the raw DTO string
Decision: `SessionsService`/`TermsService` wrap `dto.startsOn`/`dto.endsOn`
in `new Date(...)` before passing to Prisma, even though `class-validator`'s
`@IsDateString()` accepts a bare `"YYYY-MM-DD"`.
Reason/confirmed gotcha: Prisma's `DateTime`-backed `@db.Date` columns
reject a bare date string at the client layer ("premature end of input,
expected ISO-8601 DateTime") — caught by e2e tests exercising session/term
creation, not by typecheck (the DTO type is `string` either way).

## 2026-07-12 — Shared pagination DTO/helper and Prisma-unique-constraint→409 helper
Decision: `common/pagination/{pagination-query.dto,paginate}.ts` (page/pageSize
validation + the `{ items, total, page, pageSize }` envelope) and
`common/prisma/prisma-errors.ts` (`throwIfUniqueConstraint`, matches Prisma's
P2002) are shared across schools/sessions/terms/class-levels/class-arms.
Reason: every list endpoint and every unique-name conflict in this step needs
identical behavior (CLAUDE.md §5); one helper avoids five near-identical
copies.


## 2026-07-12 — Refresh tokens are opaque random strings, not JWTs
Decision: `refresh_tokens.token_hash` stores SHA-256 of a 48-byte random
`base64url` string returned to the client, not a signed JWT. Access tokens
remain signed JWTs (`JWT_ACCESS_SECRET`, 15m).
Reason: refresh validity is already a DB round trip (revocation/rotation
state lives only there), so a self-verifying JWT refresh token would just
duplicate that check with no benefit. `JWT_REFRESH_SECRET` is provisioned
and reserved for env-validation purposes even though it isn't consumed by
token-signing code yet.

## 2026-07-12 — Refresh-token "family" = all of a user's tokens, not a per-chain family_id
Decision: reuse detection (presenting an already-revoked refresh token)
revokes every non-revoked `refresh_tokens` row for that `user_id`, not just
the rotation chain the reused token came from. No `family_id` column was
added — schema changes were explicitly out of scope for this step.
Reason: matches the spec's own wording ("revokes the entire family for that
user") and needs no migration; the tradeoff is that a user's *other*, unrelated
sessions also get logged out on reuse, which is an acceptable false-positive
cost for v0.1.

## 2026-07-12 — Login timing-safety via a precomputed dummy bcrypt hash
Decision: `bcrypt.compare(password, user?.passwordHash ?? DUMMY_HASH)` always
runs, where `DUMMY_HASH` is `bcrypt.hashSync(...)` computed once at module
load (cost 12), never a real credential.
Reason: keeps bcrypt compare cost identical whether the school, email, or
active-user lookup failed, so response timing can't distinguish "unknown
account" from "wrong password."

## 2026-07-12 — Two separate JWT secrets, both required at boot
Decision: `JWT_ACCESS_SECRET` / `JWT_REFRESH_SECRET`, both `min(32)` chars,
added to the Zod `envSchema` with no defaults.
Reason: compromising one shouldn't compromise the other; boot-time
validation matches the existing "refuse to boot with missing required env"
rule (SPEC_V0.1.md §5).

## 2026-07-12 — Global AllExceptionsFilter added in step 3, not step 1/2
Decision: `src/common/filters/all-exceptions.filter.ts` implements the
`{ statusCode, message, error, path, timestamp }` envelope from CLAUDE.md §5
and is wired via a shared `configureApp()` (`src/bootstrap.ts`) used by both
`main.ts` and the e2e test bootstrap.
Reason: auth is the first module producing real 401/403/429/400 responses;
no prior step needed it since `/health` never errors in a way clients see.

## 2026-07-12 — Custom ThrottlerGuard tracks by user id when authenticated, IP otherwise
Decision: `AppThrottlerGuard` overrides `getTracker` to return
`req.user?.userId ?? req.ip`. Verified against `@nestjs/core`'s
`GuardsConsumer.tryActivate` (runs global guards in the exact order they're
registered as `APP_GUARD` providers) that `JwtAuthGuard` must be registered
*before* `AppThrottlerGuard` in `AppModule` for this to work — otherwise the
throttler always runs first, `request.user` is never set yet, and every
route silently falls back to IP-only tracking. Route-level `@Throttle()`
overrides tighten `/auth/login` (10/min/IP) and `/schools/search`
(30/min/IP) per spec.
Reason: default `nestjs/throttler` only tracks by IP; CLAUDE.md §5 asks for
100/min *per user* globally.

## 2026-07-12 — @nestjs/jwt, @nestjs/throttler, class-validator, class-transformer added
Decision: four new dependencies in `apps/api/package.json`.
Reason: each is required to implement something CLAUDE.md already mandates
by name — "JWT" (§2), "Nest throttler" (§5), "class-validator DTOs" (§2/§5) —
not a substitution for anything in the fixed stack.


## 2026-07-12 — Prisma schema (10 tables), hand-written migration for what the DSL can't express
Decision: full Prisma schema for every SPEC_V0.1.md §1 table. IDs use
`@default(uuid(7))` (client-side UUIDv7, no DB extension needed).
`citext`/`pg_trgm` enabled via `extensions = [citext, pg_trgm]` +
`previewFeatures = ["postgresqlExtensions"]`. `refresh_tokens` has no
`school_id` column (only reachable via `user_id`, whose owning user
already carries `school_id`) — a deliberate exception to CLAUDE.md §4's
general rule, following the spec's explicit table definition.
Reason: matches spec exactly; `refresh_tokens` scoping is transitive and
never queried cross-tenant directly.

## 2026-07-12 — Partial unique indexes and trigram indexes are hand-written SQL, not in schema.prisma
Decision: `apps/api/prisma/migrations/20260712104944_init/migration.sql`
was generated via `prisma migrate dev --create-only`, then hand-edited to
add: `academic_sessions_one_current_per_school` and
`terms_one_current_per_session` (partial unique indexes, `WHERE
is_current = true`), plus `students_first_name_trgm_idx` /
`students_last_name_trgm_idx` (GIN + `gin_trgm_ops`, for ILIKE name
search per §5). None of these are declared in `schema.prisma` — Prisma's
DSL has no syntax for partial indexes or operator classes.
Reason/confirmed gotcha: verified via `prisma migrate diff
--from-migrations ... --to-schema-datamodel ...` that running a bare
`prisma migrate dev` after this proposes `DROP INDEX` on the two
**trigram** indexes (they're plain GIN indexes Prisma can "see" but
doesn't recognize as wanted). The **partial** unique indexes were *not*
flagged — Prisma's diffing appears not to model partial indexes at all,
so they're silently safe. **Rule for every future migration in this
repo: always run `prisma migrate dev --create-only` first and read the
generated SQL before applying — if it contains `DROP INDEX
"students_first_name_trgm_idx"` or `"students_last_name_trgm_idx"`,
delete those lines before applying.**

## 2026-07-12 — Health check switched from raw pg to PrismaService
Decision: `HealthService`'s DB check now runs `prisma.$queryRaw` via the
shared `PrismaService` instead of a one-off `pg.Client`. The `pg`
dependency was removed from `apps/api/package.json`.
Reason: step 1 justified the raw client because no ORM/schema existed
yet; now that Prisma is set up, a second direct-`pg` connection just for
health checks is redundant.

## 2026-07-12 — TenantContext + forSchool scaffolding added, no consumers yet
Decision: `apps/api/src/common/tenant/tenant-context.ts` (request-scoped,
reads `request.user?.schoolId`, throws if accessed before a guard
populates it) and `for-school.ts` (`forSchool(schoolId, where)` helper)
per CLAUDE.md §4's required structural pattern. Nothing consumes them
yet — no `JwtAuthGuard`/`request.user` exists until step 3.
Reason: scaffolding requested explicitly for step 2 so step 3+ domain
modules have the seam ready.

## 2026-07-12 — Health check uses raw pg/ioredis, not Prisma
Decision: `HealthService` pings Postgres and Redis with the `pg` and `ioredis`
clients directly instead of via Prisma.
Reason: no Prisma schema exists yet (step 2 scope) — introducing one just to
back a health check would be premature.

## 2026-07-12 — Global JwtAuthGuard not wired yet
Decision: no global auth guard is registered in step 1; the only route
(`GET /health`) is reachable with no guard at all, not via an `@Public()`
bypass.
Reason: no auth strategy/module exists yet (step 3 scope); a global guard
with nothing behind it would just break boot.

## 2026-07-12 — No client-side router added yet
Decision: `apps/web/src/App.tsx` renders `LoginPage` directly; no
`react-router-dom` dependency added.
Reason: not part of the fixed tech stack in CLAUDE.md §2, and step 1 only
needs a single static route. Routing/guards are introduced in step 6 (web
auth + shell) per `docs/SPEC_V0.1.md` §6.

## 2026-07-12 — No combined root `dev` script
Decision: README documents running `apps/api` and `apps/web` dev servers in
two separate terminals instead of adding a `concurrently` dependency for a
single root `dev` script.
Reason: keeps step 1 dependencies to only what's in the fixed stack.

## 2026-07-12 — e2e test env vars set via Jest `setupFiles`, not `beforeAll`
Decision: default `DATABASE_URL`/`REDIS_URL`/`CORS_ORIGIN` for the e2e suite
are set in `test/setup-env.ts`, wired via `setupFiles` in `jest-e2e.json`.
Reason: `ConfigModule.forRoot({ validate })` runs eagerly when `AppModule` is
imported, which happens before `beforeAll` executes — setting env vars there
was too late and failed validation every run.

## 2026-07-12 — Dockerfiles copy full source before `pnpm install`
Decision: `apps/api/Dockerfile` and `apps/web/Dockerfile` copy
`packages/shared` and the app's own source in full before running
`pnpm install --frozen-lockfile`, rather than copying only `package.json`
files first for layer-cache optimization.
Reason: the root `prepare` script builds `packages/shared` on every
install; with only `package.json` copied, `tsc` had no `src/` to compile
and the build failed. Correctness over cache-layer optimization at this
repo size.

## 2026-07-12 — packages/shared wiring is a live health-check badge, not a type-only import
Decision: `apps/web` imports `HealthResponse` from `@scholametric/shared` to
type a TanStack Query hook that shows an "API reachable" badge on the login
page, rather than an unused type-only import.
Reason: proves the shared-types contract with real, functioning code instead
of a dead import that only exists to satisfy a rule.
