# API reference

Base URL: `http://localhost:3000` (all endpoints below `/api/v1` except
`/health`, which is intentionally unprefixed and public).

Unless marked **Public**, every endpoint requires `Authorization: Bearer
<accessToken>` — the global `JwtAuthGuard` 401s everything else. Errors use
one envelope everywhere:

```json
{
  "statusCode": 401,
  "message": "Unauthorized",
  "error": "Unauthorized",
  "path": "/api/v1/auth/me",
  "timestamp": "2026-07-12T10:00:00.000Z"
}
```

## Auth

### `POST /auth/login`

Public. Rate limited: 10 req/min per IP.

**Body**
```json
{ "email": "admin@sunrise.test", "password": "...", "schoolSlug": "sunrise" }
```
`schoolSlug` scopes the email lookup (the same email may exist at two
schools).

**Response `200`**
```json
{
  "accessToken": "...",
  "refreshToken": "...",
  "user": {
    "id": "...",
    "email": "admin@sunrise.test",
    "firstName": "Adaobi",
    "lastName": "Nwachukwu",
    "role": "SCHOOL_ADMIN",
    "schoolId": "...",
    "school": { "id": "...", "name": "Sunrise College", "slug": "sunrise" }
  }
}
```

**Response `401`** — wrong password, wrong `schoolSlug`, unknown email, and a
disabled/soft-deleted user all return the exact same generic message (no
distinguishing responses, no timing side-channel):
```json
{ "statusCode": 401, "message": "Invalid email, password, or school.", "error": "Unauthorized", ... }
```

### `POST /auth/refresh`

Public.

**Body**: `{ "refreshToken": "..." }`

**Response `200`**: new `{ accessToken, refreshToken }` pair. The presented
refresh token is revoked on use (rotation).

**Response `401`**: unknown, expired, or already-revoked token. Presenting an
already-revoked token is treated as reuse and revokes every other active
refresh token for that user (forces re-login everywhere).

### `POST /auth/logout`

Requires a valid access token.

**Body**: `{ "refreshToken": "..." }` — revokes that refresh token.

**Response `200`**: `{ "success": true }`

### `GET /auth/me`

Requires a valid access token.

**Response `200`**
```json
{
  "id": "...",
  "email": "admin@sunrise.test",
  "firstName": "Adaobi",
  "lastName": "Nwachukwu",
  "role": "SCHOOL_ADMIN",
  "status": "ACTIVE",
  "lastLoginAt": "2026-07-12T10:00:00.000Z",
  "school": { "id": "...", "name": "Sunrise College", "slug": "sunrise", "type": "SECONDARY", "status": "ACTIVE" }
}
```

## Schools

List endpoints below use the shared pagination shape: query `?page=&pageSize=`
(`pageSize` ≤ 100, default 20), response `{ items, total, page, pageSize }`,
ordering always tiebreaks on `id`.

### `GET /schools/search?q=`

Public. Rate limited: 30 req/min per IP. Used by the login page's school
picker.

Returns up to 10 `ACTIVE` schools matching `q` on name (ILIKE) or slug —
`{ id, name, slug }` only, nothing else. Queries under 2 characters return
`[]`.

**Response `200`**
```json
[{ "id": "...", "name": "Sunrise College", "slug": "sunrise" }]
```

### `POST /schools`

`SUPER_ADMIN` only.

Creates the school and its first `SCHOOL_ADMIN` user in one transaction. If
the slug already exists, nothing is created (409) — not even the admin user.

**Body**
```json
{
  "name": "Riverside Academy",
  "slug": "riverside",
  "type": "SECONDARY",
  "admin": { "email": "admin@riverside.test", "firstName": "...", "lastName": "...", "password": "..." }
}
```

**Response `201`**: the school row plus `{ admin: { id, email, firstName, lastName, role } }`.

**Response `409`**: slug already in use.

### `GET /schools`

`SUPER_ADMIN` only. Paginated list of every school (not just `ACTIVE` ones —
this is the platform directory, distinct from the public `/schools/search`).

### `GET /schools/:id`

`SUPER_ADMIN` only. `404` if the id doesn't exist.

### `PATCH /schools/:id`

`SUPER_ADMIN` only. Body: any of `name`, `type`, `address`, `phone`, `email`,
`status` — `slug` is immutable and not accepted here.

---

## School setup

`SCHOOL_ADMIN` only, all endpoints below. Every resource is scoped to the
caller's own school via the access token's `schoolId` — never from the
request body/query/params. Fetching or patching another school's resource by
its real ID returns `404`, not `403`.

### `GET /sessions`

Paginated, ordered by `startsOn` descending.

### `POST /sessions`

Body: `{ name, startsOn, endsOn }` (dates as `YYYY-MM-DD`). `409` on a
duplicate `name` within the school.

### `PATCH /sessions/:id`

Body: any of `name`, `startsOn`, `endsOn`. `isCurrent` is not settable here —
only `/activate` changes it.

### `POST /sessions/:id/activate`

Sets `isCurrent: true` on this session and `false` on every other session in
the school, atomically (deactivate-then-activate in one transaction, so the
one-current-per-school constraint is never violated mid-flight).

**Response `200`**: the activated session.

### `GET /terms?sessionId=`

`sessionId` (query, required) scopes the list to one session. Paginated,
ordered by `startsOn` ascending.

### `POST /terms`

Body: `{ sessionId, name, startsOn, endsOn }` — `name` is one of `FIRST`,
`SECOND`, `THIRD`. `404` if `sessionId` doesn't belong to the caller's school.
`409` on a duplicate `name` within the session.

### `POST /terms/:id/activate`

Same atomic deactivate-then-activate pattern as sessions, scoped to the
term's session (one current term per session).

### `GET /class-levels`

Paginated, ordered by `rank` ascending.

### `POST /class-levels`

Body: `{ name, rank }`. `409` on a duplicate `name` within the school (the
same name in a different school is fine).

### `PATCH /class-levels/:id`

Body: any of `name`, `rank`.

### `GET /class-arms?classLevelId=`

`classLevelId` (query, optional) filters to one class level. Paginated,
ordered by `name` ascending.

### `POST /class-arms`

Body: `{ name, classLevelId }`. `404` if `classLevelId` doesn't belong to the
caller's school. `409` on a duplicate `name` within the class level.

### `PATCH /class-arms/:id`

Body: any of `name`, `classLevelId`. If `classLevelId` is provided, it must
belong to the caller's school (`404` otherwise).

## Misc

### `GET /health`

Public. No authentication required.

**Response `200`**
```json
{
  "status": "ok",
  "db": true,
  "redis": true
}
```

`status` is `"ok"` only when both `db` and `redis` are `true`; otherwise
`"error"`. `db`/`redis` reflect a live connectivity check performed on every
request (no caching).
